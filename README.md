# Congressional-Voting-Missing-Data-Filling
Filling missing data for congressional voting dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Apply recommender systems methods to a very nonstandard RS problem, analyzing voting data in Congress. Here are the details:

* The dataset is in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, under the title " Congressional Voting Records Data Set."
* Cast this as an RS problem, with the members of Congress being the "moviegoers," the legislative bills being the "movies," and the votes (1 for yes, 0 for non-yes) being the "ratings."
* The goal is to predict the missing votes, coded as '?' in the data.
